# SPO Token Contract

A simple ERC-20 token contract with minting and burning functionalities, designed for use on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Description

The `SPO Token` contract is a customizable ERC-20 token built using OpenZeppelin's secure and battle-tested libraries. This contract includes standard ERC-20 functionality with additional features for minting new tokens and burning existing ones. It also allows for token transfers and is controlled by an owner who has exclusive access to the minting functionality.

### Features:
- **Minting**: The contract owner can mint new tokens and assign them to a specified address.
- **Burning**: Any token holder can burn a portion of their tokens, reducing the total supply.
- **Transfers**: Token holders can transfer tokens to other addresses.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To use this contract, you'll need access to the [Remix Ethereum IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

1. **Open Remix**:
   - Go to the Remix IDE at [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

2. **Create a New File**:
   - In the Remix IDE, create a new Solidity file (e.g., `SPOToken.sol`).

3. **Copy the Contract Code**:
   - Copy and paste the following Solidity code into your newly created file:

    ```solidity
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

    import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
    import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

    contract token is ERC20, Ownable {
        constructor(address initialOwner)
            ERC20("SPO", "26")
            Ownable(initialOwner)
        {}

        function burn(uint256 amount) external {
            _burn(_msgSender(), amount);
        }

        function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
            _mint(to, amount);
        }

        function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount)
            public
            override
            returns (bool)
        {
            _transfer(_msgSender(), recipient, amount);
            return true;
        }
    }
    ```

### Executing Program

1. **Compile the Contract**:
   - In the Remix IDE, select the appropriate Solidity compiler version (`^0.8.20`).
   - Click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left sidebar.
   - Click the "Compile SPOToken.sol" button to compile the contract.

2. **Deploy the Contract**:
   - After successfully compiling the contract, navigate to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left sidebar.
   - Select "Injected Web3" as the environment if you want to deploy on a testnet like Rinkeby, or "JavaScript VM (London)" for a local simulation.
   - Ensure that the `token` contract is selected in the "Contract" dropdown.
   - For the constructor, enter the owner's address in the `initialOwner` field.
   - Click "Deploy" to deploy the contract.

3. **Interact with the Contract**:
   - Once deployed, the contract's functions will be available under the "Deployed Contracts" section.
   - **Minting Tokens**: As the owner, call the `mint` function, entering the recipient's address and the amount of tokens to mint.
   - **Burning Tokens**: Any token holder can call the `burn` function to burn a specified amount of their tokens.
   - **Transferring Tokens**: Use the `transfer` function to send tokens to another address.

## Help

If you encounter any issues:

- **Compilation Errors**: Ensure the Solidity version in Remix is set to `^0.8.20`.
- **Deployment Issues**: Double-check that the correct environment (e.g., Injected Web3 for testnets) is selected in Remix.
